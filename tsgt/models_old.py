  This model performs autoregressive language modeling:

    - input: Array representing a batch of text strings via token IDs
      plus padding markers; shape is (batch_size, sequence_length). Array
      elements are integers in ``range(vocab_size)``, and 0 values mark padding
      positions.

    - output: 3-D array of raw activations with last/innermost dimension of
      ``vocab_size``, suitable for decoding into a batch of token strings;
      shape is (batch_size, sequence_length, ``vocab_size``).

  This model uses only the decoder part of the overall Transformer.

  Args:
    vocab_size: Input vocabulary size -- each element of the input array
        should be an integer in ``range(vocab_size)``. These integers typically
        represent token IDs from a vocabulary-based tokenizer.
    d_model: Last/innermost dimension of activation arrays at most points in
        the model, including the initial embedding output.
    d_ff_mul: Last/innermost dimension multiplier of special (typically wider)
        :py:class:`Dense` layer in the feedforward part of each encoder block.
    n_layers: Number of decoder blocks. Each block includes attention, dropout,

        layers.
    n_heads: Number of attention heads.
    max_len: Maximum symbol length for positional encoding.
    dropout: Stochastic rate (probability) for dropping an activation value
        when applying dropout within decoder blocks. The same rate is also
        used for attention dropout in decoder blocks.
    dropout_shared_axes: Tensor axes on which to share a dropout mask.
        Sharing along batch and sequence axes (``dropout_shared_axes=(0,1)``)
        is a useful way to save memory and apply consistent masks to activation
        vectors at different sequence positions.
    mode: If ``'predict'``, use fast inference. If ``'train'``, each decoder
        block will include dropout; else, it will pass all values through
        unaltered.
    ff_activation: Type of activation function at the end of each encoder

    precision: int or None; precision in representation used in
        discretization scheme.

  Returns:
    A Transformer language model that maps strings (represented as token ID
    sequences) to sequences of raw (non-normalized) activation vectors; each
    vector in the sequence can be mapped (e.g., by `argmax`) to a token ID.
